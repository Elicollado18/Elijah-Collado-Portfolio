        <p> Greetings! 
      <br> 
    </br> 
  My name is Elijah and I am a Film Production Major who is passionate about screenwriting, videography, and video editing. I was inspired by film at a young age and became attracted to all aspects of filmmaking through academic assignments. <br /> 
  <br> I have always had an interest in crafting unique stories and trying to find entertaining ways to communicate them, but I found the postproduction aspect of film to be particularly interesting. I became passionate about Filmmaking in my 7th-grade physics class while working on an extra credit opportunity, believe it or not. I wrote, directed, and edited a music video about kinetic and potential energy, called "Started From The Top", which was a cover for Drake's "Started From The Bottom". Ever since my video was repeatedly played in class that year, I pursued programs that would provide me with the skills I needed to be as successful as I can in clearly communicating my ideas through Filmmaking. Throughout my High School and Collegiate careers, I was able to participate in many courses, acquiring various skills and practicing on programs such as Adobe Premiere, Avid Media Composer, Pro Tools, and Photoshop.</br>
<br> I am actively searching for opportunities to assist in projects wherever help is needed. I believe that my work ethic, attention to detail and passion for filmmaking give me an advantage in the value that I am able to bring to a production.</br>
